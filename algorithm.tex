%% What is an algorithm?
%%
%% Main idea: an algorithm is a finite sequence of instructions which, when
%% performed, reliably perform some task.
%%
%% Subpoints:
%%   1. finite: a finite algorithm is sufficient to perform an infinite number
%%      of tasks.
%%   2. sequence: a sequence can be expressed at various levels of granularity
%%      (low, medium, high, for example)
%%   3. task: one task may have many algorithms that perform it (though some
%%      have none at all [computability], and some have none that are efficient
%%      [complexity]).
